## Project
In this project data coming from audio streaming company called Sparkify has been modeled with Apache Cassandra. They have raw CSV metadata but no easy way to query the data.
The goal of this project is to design and create a NoSQL database and ETL pipeline optimized.

## Dataset
The dataset is user songplay log files in CSV format generated by this [event simulator]. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.
Here are examples of filepaths to two files in the dataset:
`event_data/2018-11-01-events.csv`

## Dataset after denormalization that will be used for Apache Casssandra tables
The image below shows the denormalized dataset:

### Instructions
- transfers data from a set of CSV files within a directory to create a streamlined CSV file to model and insert data into Apache Cassandra tables.
- Transfer the CSV files from **event_data** to create a streamlined CSV file *event_datafile_new.csv* to model and insert data into Apache Cassandra tables.
- Create database connection to Cassandra 
- Create keyspace in Cassandra 
- Creates the 3 tables designed to run the queries
- Inserts the data into the tables
- Runs the queries
